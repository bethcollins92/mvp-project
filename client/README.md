This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction

This is an app for the user to select exercises to complete every day. Each lasts only 5 minutes, and the user must choose one from each health category. The app will create a plan for the person and set the times they should do the exercises every day.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### Dependencies

Run `yarn` on root folder to install dependencies related to Express.

`cd client` and run `yarn` install dependencies related to React.

### Run Your Development Servers

- Run `yarn start` in project directory to start the Express server on port 5000
- `cd client` and run `yarn start` to start client server in development mode with hot reloading in port 3000.
- Client is configured so all API calls will be proxied to port 5000 for a smoother development experience. Yay!
- You can test your client app in `http://localhost:3000`
- You can test your API in `http://localhost:5000/api`
